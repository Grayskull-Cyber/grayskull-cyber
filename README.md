In a former life I was a systems administrator for a web hosting company. In mid 2000's made the decision to chase my goal of becoming a game developer. Over the last decaded I had the opportunity to work on many awesome projects and awarded for my hard work and dedication to my craft. In 2020 I felt it was time for a new challenge and set my goals on becoming an analyst where I can use my skill sets and love for technology to protect and defend agaist cyber threats.
